								<h3>The Bible</h3>
								<p>We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, revealed to it's human authors by the power of the Holy Spirit</p>
							</article>
							<article class="txt-align-center">
								<h3>The Trinity</h3>
								<p>We believe that God exists in eternal, loving community in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit</p>
							</article>
							<article class="txt-align-center">
								<h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
								<p>We believe that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity (God the Son), is fully God and fully man, and the savior of all. He was born to the virgin Mary through the power of the Holy Spirit, suffered under Pontius Pilate, and was crucified, dead and buried. He was raised from the dead three days later; defeating death, sin and the devil, and reconciling all people to God. He ascended into heaven and will return to establish His kingdom on earth</p>
							</article>
							<article class="txt-align-center">
								<h3>Humanity and Salvation</h3>
								<p>We believe that all humanity is captive to sin which leads to death. Salvation from sin and death is by the loving grace of God, achieved through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This grace is offered to all and is applied to those who willingly repent of their sins and enter into loving relationship with Him</p>
							</article>
							<article class="txt-align-center">
								<h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
								<p>We believe that The Holy Spirit is the third person (God the Holy Spirit) and lovingly drawing all people into relationship with God and indwells every believer.  He works within the believer to conform them to the character and image of Christ, bestows upon them particular spiritual gifts, and empowers them for vocation/ministry</p>
							</article>
							<article class="txt-align-center">
								<h3>One Holy Universal Church</h3>
								<p>We believe that the Church of Christ is diverse in its expression, and as such is greater than any particular congregation or denomination. The Church consists of all those who are in loving relationship with Jesus Christ and its purpose is to exemplify God's love to all people</p>
							</article>
							<article class="txt-align-center">
								<h3>Holy Communion and Baptism</h3>
								<p>We believe that Holy Communion and Baptism are ordinances given by God to His Church to practice. Holy Communion is practiced in our congregation through the communal partaking of bread wafers and grape juice, symbolizing Christ's body and blood. We baptize by immersion in water only those who have come to relationship with Christ</p>
